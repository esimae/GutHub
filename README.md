Thanks for teaching us how to use Flutter, Dart, and run web based applications that work on any screen!

Food bloggers, chefs, and recipe testers often have their own beautiful websites where they can store a repository of their signature dishes

But it’s hard for the ordinary person or aspiring chef to make one of their own, without software experience or the resources to create their own site.

To break down this barrier, we created a user friendly application where anyone can store and search through their own recipes in their own personal cookbook.

Often, the food we most love to eat most is the special recipes of friends and family that we’ve grown up eating, rather than the random recipes we find online.

With an aim for extensibility, GutHub will soon allow you share your own, signature cookbook with others. Appreciate the great recipes created by your friends and community! Preserve those precious, passed down recipes from your family - no more hunting through old notebooks or files anymore.
